# EX 9 C program to find the sum of odd digits using do while loop.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to find the sum of odd digits using do while loop.

## Algorithm:
1.Start the program.
2.Take input of a number num and initialize sum to 0.
3.Use a do-while loop to extract each digit of num.
4.Check if the digit is odd; if yes, add it to sum.
5.Print the sum and end the program.

## Program:
```

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, sum = 0, digit;
    scanf("%d", &num);
    do {
        digit = num % 10;
        if (digit % 2 != 0)
            sum += digit;
        num /= 10;
    } while (num != 0);
    printf("%d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
